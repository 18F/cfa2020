## Presentations
### Taking the BS out of Bids
Agencies put a lot of work into writing request for proposals. Bidders put in a lot of work writing proposals. As an agency, how can you understand if a bidder is really going to collaborate with you the way you’re hoping? How do you know whether a vendor really practices what they preach or if they are just stringing together buzz words? As a bidder, how should you interpret the new procurement strategies agencies are trying? How can you position yourself as a partner and show that you can deliver value while keeping scope in mind? 18F will discuss evaluation advice we’re giving agencies and what makes great bidders stand out.
